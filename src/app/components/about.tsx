      <p className="text-center text-2xl sm:text-lg mb-4 font-medium">
        I&apos;m passionate about computers since I was a kid. Building PCs for
        gaming with my dad was my favorite hobbie, since then this passion grew
        year by year, and I had my first experience with scripting in Team
        Fortress 2. I went from creating configs to my classes to programming
        embedded systems with PIC coding in C. Then I started my bachelor, my
        college was not meeting my expectations, so I dropped college and became
        a self-taught developer, and that was the point where I really begin to
        improve faster in web development.
